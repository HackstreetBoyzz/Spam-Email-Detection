# SpamEmailDetection
Spam Email Detection using a Bloom Filter efficiently identifies spam by hashing known spam keywords, senders, or message patterns into a compact data structure. Incoming emails are checked against the filter for matches, enabling fast detection with minimal memory use and a small, controllable false positive rate.
